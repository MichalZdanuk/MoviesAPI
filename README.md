# MoviesAPI

This repository demonstrates the usage of the **Decorator Pattern** in a simple API implementation. The progression of this implementation is organized into stages, with each stage represented by a specific commit. These stages showcase how step-by-step adoption of the Decorator Pattern enhances code readability and maintainability.

## ðŸš€ Stages of Implementation

### **Stage 1: Initial Implementation Without Decorators**  
A basic API implementation is introduced, without any decorators.  
[View Commit: Initial Implementation](https://github.com/MichalZdanuk/MoviesAPI/commit/51ff876ddc35a62db2e550e521fea77b8f49379c)

### **Stage 2: Adding Caching Mechanism**  
The service implementation is extended to include a caching mechanism, improving performance.

### **Stage 3: Extracting Caching Using Decorators**  
The caching logic is refactored into a decorator, isolating it from the core functionality.

### **Stage 4: Adding Logging with Decorators**  
A logging mechanism is added, implemented as a decorator for better separation of concerns.

### **Stage 5: Refactoring with Scrutor for Dependency Injection**  
The code is refactored to use the **Scrutor** library, simplifying dependency injection and further improving the modularity of the implementation.
